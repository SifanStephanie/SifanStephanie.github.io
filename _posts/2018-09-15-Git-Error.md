# Git Error - ERROR: Permission to XXX.git denied to ZZZ.

I want to use one key for two accounts of myself to access Github, but Github could not be able to tell which of my account I want to use.  This means that I could not have many accounts using the same public key, because GitHub could not identify which one of me is using, then there is no security.  

The error message is:
{% highlight ruby %}
Permission to XXX.git denied to ZZZ.
fatal: unable to access "https://github.com/XXX.git": The requested URL returned error:403
{% endhighlight %}

The way to solve this is to get multiple public key, and then you could use as many as accounts as you like!

**There are the steps:**

**1. Get a new SSH KEY**

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C “any_name_you_want”


The *id_rsa* is the old key on your computer, so you could make a new file to save your new key and make passphrase for it (it is ok to have no passphrase).

**2. Put your new key on the GitHub**

Just using the *“New SSH key”* button and add your key to make a new SSH KEY.

**3. Generate ~/.ssh/config**
